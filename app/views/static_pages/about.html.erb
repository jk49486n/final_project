<p>

<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">The <b>Delta Theta</b> chapter of Sigma Delta Tau was founded on <b>February 11th, 2007</b> at <b>Pace University</b>.</h1>
The sisters of the Delta Theta chapter come from different backgrounds, and literally from all over the world.
We each bring a unique story with us that comes from having our own interests and experiences. No matter how different we may be, we are able to come together as sisters to encourage, empower, and support one another in a way that is only found by joining such a diverse sisterhood. Our chapter truly embodies the city we get to call home.
